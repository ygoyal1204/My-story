The Monkey and the lion

There was a lion in the forest. 
One day this lion was hungry and he met a young monkey on his way, so he thought he would eat the monkey instead of being hungry all the time.
So he said to the monkey,"I am hungry and I haven't found anything to eat this day. 
I know you are not enough for me, but I am going to eat you young monkey." The monkey was in a big problem, but found a way to run away from the lion.
He changed the subject. He said, "Do you want to play together, what your father and my father used to play? Because they were friends."
The lion said, "Oh, I didn't know that that's interesting, what's the game?"
The monkey was bluffing. Both the monkey and the lion went to a big area that had machines, because the monkey said, "I've to find machines to play."
